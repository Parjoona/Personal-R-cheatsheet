Machine learning is a method of data analysis
# Made to automate analytical model building
# Uses algorithms to learn from data
# Finds hidden insights without being told to.

Process of machine learning
# Data acquision
# Cleaning data, model training & building
# Cleaning data, test data
# Model training repeat
# Model deployment

Supervised learning
# Algorithms are trained using labeled examples
# Input is where the output is know
# Recives inputs along with correct outputs
# Compares these to find errors
# > Modifies the model accordingly

Unsupervised learning
# Takes no historical labels
# Does not know the right answer, figures it out
# Explores data to find structure
# Uses for example, learnest neightbor mapping
# k-means clustering or single value decomposition

Reinforcement learning
# Used in robotics, gaming and navigation
# Discovers through trial and error
# Greatest reward gives highest "points"
# 3 components (agent: learner / decision maker)
# (environment: everything it interacts with)
# (actions: everything it does)
